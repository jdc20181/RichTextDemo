#What's in the Box?

-RichTextBoxPrintCtrl 
This is the main component, and you will need to build your project and look for it in your toolbox!

-Main.vb
I Added basically a page break method so if it is greater than X characters it will print the next page. 

-Extras
In the Extras folder I have a full blown example for a wordpad like program!

-License
MIT, use as you wish unless you use the Extra examples add:
